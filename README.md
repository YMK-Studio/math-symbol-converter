# 𝐀𝛂 Math Symbol Converter

Math Symbol Converter is a keyboard macro program that allows you to quickly convert various mathematical symbols using familiar aliases, many of which are LaTeX-based. You can type a backslash (`\`) followed by the alias of a symbol and press the `TAB` key to convert it into the corresponding symbol.

## ⚠️ Limitations

This program works well in most web-based text editors (e.g., Notion), web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox), and certain desktop text editors like Notepad and newer versions of Sticky Notes. However, it may not function as expected in some specialized applications—such as older versions of Sticky Notes, Visual Studio, MS Word, and certain online games—due to limitations in detecting windows through the WinAPI `GetWindowThreadProcessId` function or potential conflicts with programs that use custom key-handling features.
